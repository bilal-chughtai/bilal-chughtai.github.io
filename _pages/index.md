title: Bilal Chughtai
---

I am currently an independent ML and AI Safety Researcher. My main research interest is AI alignment: the problem of building AI systems that are aligned with human values. 

Previously, I was a scholar in the [SERI MATS](https://www.serimats.org/alumni) program, working on mechanistic interpretability with Neel Nanda. Before that, I was an [MLSS](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CphfDP4ynz3QQ4AKY/introducing-the-ml-safety-scholars-program) scholar. I have an MMath in mathematics from the University of Cambridge, where I was primarily interested in theoretical physics.
