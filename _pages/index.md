I do ML and AI Safety research. My research interests are in better *understanding* how powerful general AI systems function with the hope that this contributes to their safe and benefecial development. I am interested in (mechanistic) interpretability, AI safety and AI alignment.

Previously, I was a scholar in the [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/alumni) program, working on mechanistic interpretability with Neel Nanda. Before that, I was an [MLSS](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CphfDP4ynz3QQ4AKY/introducing-the-ml-safety-scholars-program) scholar. I have an MMath in mathematics from the University of Cambridge, where I was primarily interested in theoretical physics.
